This is my first Django app where I have attempted to create a restful API which can later be connected to a front-end application. It currently has a sqlLite database linked to it and four models representing four tables. The models have been migrated to the database. 

It has a admin page where data in the tables can be viewed. Also I have created a POST and READ call, but need to get them to work on POSTMAN. This project is currently unfinished, but has given me an introduction to Django and Python.
